### What is Microservices?
Microservices is an architectural style where an application is developed
as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each 
other through well-defined APIs.

### Benefits of Microservices:
1. Scalability
2. Flexibility
3. Resilience: Failure in one service doesn’t necessarily bring down the entire system.
4. Faster Development: Teams can work on different services simultaneously, 
                        leading to faster development cycles.

### Challenges Faced by Microservices:
1. Managing service interactions
2. Ensuring data consistency
    Data consistency: It ensures that data remains accurate, reliable, and uniform across a system
3. Dealing with increased complexity in deployment and monitoring

### Best Ways to Establish Communication between Microservices?
1. gRPC
2. Message Brokers
    **Description**: Services communicate asynchronously through a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or Amazon SQS).
    **Pros**: Decouples services, supports asynchronous processing, and can handle high volumes of messages.
    **Cons**: Adds complexity in terms of message management and requires handling of potential message loss or duplication.
3. Event Streaming
    **Description**: Services publish and subscribe to events using a streaming platform (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis).
    **Pros**: Real-time data processing, allows event-driven architectures, and handles high throughput.
    **Cons**: Requires management of event schemas and consumer state.
